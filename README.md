# smooth-hardhat-boilerplate

Your best resource to bootstrap a Hardhat project. Ready to test with gas monitoring. All of the direct dependencies use their latest available version and the architecture is clean and easy to extend. Have fun BUIDLing! ðŸ¤™

## Usage

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Accretence/breathtaking-hardhat-erc721-template
```

2. Install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create your `.env` file according to the `sample.env` provided file.

```shell
MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY=
RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY=
ALCHEMY_RINKEBY_ENDPOINT=
ALCHEMY_MAINNET_ENDPOINT=
CMC_KEY=
ETHERSCAN_KEY=
```

4. Test the contract:

There are exhaustive tests provided in the `Test.js` file. You can run the file using this command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

## Deploying

You can deploy this contract to Rinkeby testnet. This requires funding a wallet and registering API keys with [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/introduction/getting-started) and [Etherscan]()

```shell
npm run rinkeby
```

You can also use the `verify` scripts to verify the contract on Etherscan.

```
npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby <YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

Substitute `mainnet` for `rinkeby` to deploy for realsies. good luck!
